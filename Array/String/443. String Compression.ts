/**
 * LeetCode Problem: String Compression
 *
 * Given an array of characters, compress it in-place by replacing consecutive 
 * repeating characters with the character followed by the count of occurrences.
 * The compressed result must fit within the input array, and the function returns
 * the new length of the array after compression.
 *
 * Example Input: ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
 * Expected Output: Return 6, and modify chars[] to ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Each character is visited only once.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - Modifies the input array without extra space.
