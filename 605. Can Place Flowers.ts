/**
 * LeetCode Problem: Can Place Flowers
 *
 * You have a long flowerbed in which some plots are planted (1) and some are empty (0). 
 * However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
 *
 * Given an integer array `flowerbed`, where `0` means empty and `1` means planted,
 * and an integer `n` representing the number of new flowers to be planted,
 * return `true` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without 
 * violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule, otherwise return `false`.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10^4
 * - flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
 * - 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length
 * - The flowerbed has no adjacent flowers initially.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - We iterate through the flowerbed once, skipping indices when planting.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - We modify no additional data structures.
